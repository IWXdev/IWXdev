## 🧠 About Me

I'm a beginner to intermediate game developer currently working on my first serious project using *Godot Engine*.  
I've been learning game development step by step over the past few months and sharing my journey here.

---

## 🛠 Skills & Tools

- 🌀 Godot Engine (GDScript)
- 🎨 Basic pixel art & free assets integration
- 🔁 Checkpoint systems, player health, UI
- 💾 Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 🎯 What I'm Working On

- Building my 2D platformer game called *Stach*
- Polishing mechanics (movement, damage, healing, checkpoints)
- Improving code structure and performance
- Documenting my learning process

---

## 🚀 What's Next?

After finishing *Stach*, I plan to:

- Switch to *Unity Engine*
- Learn and master *C#*
- Start developing my second game with more complex systems

## 🌱 My Goals

- Become a skilled and consistent solo developer
- Finish and publish small games regularly
- Learn game design & player experience deeply
